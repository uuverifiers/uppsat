* What to do with fixedpoint...


* Theoretical:
** Find inclusion bounds for fixed-point
** Analyse what sized models are usually needed
** Ponder about increasing width and maximum width an relation...


* Practical:
** Investigate bounds a bit more.
** Make cactus plot
** Pick 2 bit-widths, and for each bit-width 3 increments
*** Run through (100?) benchmarks
*** Compare with Z3, MathSAT, CVC4(?)

** What about the theory of fixed-point proposed. Can we use it?
